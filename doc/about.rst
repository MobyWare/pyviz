About Us
========

PyViz is a collaboration between the maintainers of
`Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org>`_,
`HoloViews <http://holoviews.org>`_,
`GeoViews <http://geo.holoviews.org>`_,
`Datashader <https://github.com/bokeh/datashader>`_, and
`Param <https://github.com/ioam/param>`_.

The authors of all of these tools are working closely together to help
make them into a coherent solution to a wide range of Python
visualization problems, funded in part by 
`Anaconda, Inc. <http://anaconda.com>`_,
