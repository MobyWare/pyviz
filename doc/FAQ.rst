Wow, how did you do all this work?
==================================

The real work is in the individual projects, not here. :) We're just trying to show you how much is now available across the different projects, and can only take credit for making good examples.


How do I report a problem?
==========================

And those projects are also to blame for your problems. ;)  Please visit the appropriate website for whichever package is involved.  If it is not clear what to do, you can always try describing your problem at the Gitter link below.
